# Key Fixes & Explanations

## License Declaration:
- Replaced `MODULE_LICENSE("LICENSE");` with `MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");`, which is valid and required for modules to load properly.

## Read Function (`myfd_read`):
- Used a temporary buffer of size `len + 1` instead of `PAGE_SIZE * 2`.
- Added error checking for `kmalloc` and ensured proper deallocation.
- Fixed the loop condition to avoid underflow when `t--`.

## Write Function (`myfd_write`):
- Prevented out-of-bounds writes by ensuring `size < PAGE_SIZE`.
- Used `str[size] = '\0';` instead of `str[size + 1] = '\0';`.

## `misc_register` Simplification:
- Replaced `misc_register(&(*(&(myfd_device))))` with `misc_register(&myfd_device)`.

## Initialization and Cleanup:
- Properly handled registration errors in `myfd_init()`.
- Unregistered the device in `myfd_cleanup()`.

## Style Improvements:
- Followed Linux kernel indentation (8 spaces or a tab per level).
- Broke long lines (>80 characters) into multiple lines.
- Grouped related code logically with meaningful comments.

# Behavior

## Read Operation:
- Reading from `/dev/reverse` returns the reversed string written by the user.
- EOF is reached when `offs` exceeds the string length.

## Write Operation:
- Writing a string to `/dev/reverse` stores it in the kernel buffer.
- Strings longer than `PAGE_SIZE` are rejected.

## Device Node:
- When loaded, the device appears as `/dev/reverse`.
- Accessible using `cat`, `echo`, and other standard tools.
